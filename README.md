> "A dizzying lifetime... reeling by on Celluloid" _-- Rush / Between The Wheels_

Reel is a fast, non-blocking "evented" web server built on [http_parser.rb][parser],
[websocket_parser][websockets], [Celluloid::IO][celluloidio], and [nio4r][nio4r]. Thanks
to Celluloid, Reel also works great for multithreaded applications and provides
traditional multithreaded blocking I/O support too.

[parser]: https://github.com/tmm1/http_parser.rb
[websockets]: https://github.com/afcapel/websocket_parser
[celluloidio]: https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid-io
[nio4r]: https://github.com/celluloid/nio4r

Connections to Reel can be either non-blocking and handled entirely within
the Reel::Server thread, or the same connections can be dispatched to worker
threads where they will perform ordinary blocking IO. Reel provides no
built-in thread pool, however you can build one yourself using Celluloid.pool,
or because Celluloid already pools threads to begin with, you can simply use
an actor per connection.

This gives you the best of both worlds: non-blocking I/O for when you're
primarily I/O bound, and threads for where you're compute bound.

### Is it any good?

[Yes](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3067434)

Here's a "hello world" web server benchmark, run on a 2GHz i7 (OS X 10.7.3).
All servers used in a single-threaded mode.

Reel performance on various Ruby VMs:

```
# httperf --num-conns=50 --num-calls=1000

Ruby Version        Throughput    Latency
------------        ----------    -------
JRuby 1.7.0         3978 req/s    (0.3 ms/req)
rbx HEAD            2288 reqs/s   (0.4 ms/req)
Ruby 1.9.3          2071 req/s    (0.5 ms/req)
```

Comparison with other web servers:

```
Web Server          Throughput    Latency
----------          ----------    -------
Goliath (0.9.4)     2058 reqs/s   (0.5 ms/req)
Thin    (1.2.11)    7502 reqs/s   (0.1 ms/req)
Node.js (0.6.5)     11735 reqs/s  (0.1 ms/req)
```

All Ruby benchmarks done on Ruby 1.9.3. Latencies given are average-per-request
and are not amortized across all concurrent requests.

API
---

*NOTE: these examples are for the Reel 0.4.0.pre2 API*

Reel aims to provide a "bare metal" API that other frameworks (such as Rack
and Webmachine) can leverage. This API can also be nice in performance critical
applications.

### Block Form

Reel lets you pass a block to initialize which receives connections:

```ruby
require 'reel'

Reel::Server.supervise("0.0.0.0", 3000) do |connection|
  # Support multiple keep-alive requests per connection
  connection.each_request do |request|
    # WebSocket support
    if request.websocket?
      puts "Client made a WebSocket request to: #{request.url}"
      websocket = request.websocket

      websocket << "Hello everyone out there in WebSocket land"
      websocket.close
    else
      puts "Client requested: #{request.method} #{request.url}"
      request.respond :ok, "Hello, world!"
    end
  end
end

sleep
```

When we read a request from the incoming connection, we'll either get back
a Reel::Request object, indicating a normal HTTP connection, or a
Reel::WebSocket object for WebSockets connections.

### Subclass Form

You can also subclass Reel, which allows additional customizations:

```ruby
require 'reel'

class MyServer < Reel::Server
  def initialize(host = "127.0.0.1", port = 3000)
    super(host, port, &method(:on_connection))
  end

  def on_connection(connection)
    connection.each_request do |request|
      if request.websocket?
        handle_websocket(request)
      else
        handle_request(request)
      end
    end
  end

  def handle_request(request)
    request.respond :ok, "Hello, world!"
  end

  def handle_websocket(sock)
    sock << "Hello everyone out there in WebSocket land!"
    sock.close
  end
end

MyServer.run
```

Framework Adapters
------------------

### Rack

A Rack adapter for Reel is available at:

https://github.com/celluloid/reel-rack

### Webmachine

The most notable library with native Reel support is
[webmachine-ruby](https://github.com/seancribbs/webmachine-ruby),
an advanced HTTP framework for Ruby with a complete state machine for proper
processing of HTTP/1.1 requests. Together with Reel, Webmachine provides
full streaming support for both requests and responses.

To use Reel with Webmachine, add the following to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'webmachine', git: 'git://github.com/seancribbs/webmachine-ruby.git'
```

Then use `config.adapter = :Reel` when configuring a Webmachine app, e.g:

```ruby
MyApp = Webmachine::Application.new do |app|
  app.routes do
    add ['*'], MyHome
  end

  app.configure do |config|
    config.ip      = MYAPP_IP
    config.port    = MYAPP_PORT
    config.adapter = :Reel

    # Optional: handler for incoming websockets
    config.adapter_options[:websocket_handler] = proc do |websocket|
      # socket is a Reel::WebSocket
      socket << "hello, world"
    end
  end
end

MyApp.run
```
